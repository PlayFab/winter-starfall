			<h1>Attachment — The Standard Contractual Clauses (Processors)</h1>
			<p>
				Acceptance of the PlayFab Terms of Service by you (as data exporter) includes acceptance of this
				Attachment, which is countersigned by PlayFab, Inc. Capitalized terms that are not defined herein will
				have the same meaning as specified in the PlayFab Terms of Service. In the event of a conflict between
				the PlayFab Terms of Service and this Attachment, the parties agree that this Attachment shall control
				interpretation of any inconsistency. However, the documents shall, to the extent possible, be construed
				to be consistent.
			</p>
			<p>
				In countries where regulatory approval is required for use of the Standard Contractual Clauses, the
				Standard Contractual Clauses cannot be relied upon under European Commission 2010/87/EU (of February
				2010) to legitimize export of data from the country, unless data exporter has the required regulatory
				approval.
			</p>
			<p>
				References to various Articles from the Directive 95/46/EC in the Standard Contractual Clauses below
				will be treated as references to the relevant and appropriate Articles in the GDPR.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC for the transfer of personal data to processors
				established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection, data exporter
				and PlayFab, Inc. (as data importer, whose signature appears below), each a “party,” together “the
				parties,” have agreed on the following Contractual Clauses (the “Clauses” or “Standard Contractual
				Clauses”) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and
				fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data
				importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1.
			</p>
			<h2>STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES</h2>
			<h3>SECTION I</h3>
			<h4>Clause 1</h4>
			<h5>Purpose and scope</h5>
			<p>
				a. The purpose of these standard contractual clauses is to ensure compliance with the requirements of
				Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the
				protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of
				such data (General Data Protection Regulation)&nbsp;^1^&nbsp;for the transfer of personal data to a
				third country.
			</p>
			<p>b. The Parties:</p>
			<pre
				class="overflow-scroll whitespace-pre-wrap"
			><code>i. the natural or legal person(s), public authority/ies, agency/ies or other body/ies (hereinafter \"entity/ies\") transferring the personal data, as listed in Annex I.A. (hereinafter each \"data exporter\"), and ii. the entity/ies in a third country receiving the personal data from the data exporter, directly or indirectly via another entity also Party to these Clauses, as listed in Annex I.A. (hereinafter each \"data importer\") have agreed to these standard contractual clauses (hereinafter: \"Clauses\").</code></pre>
			<p>c. These Clauses apply with respect to the transfer of personal data as specified in Annex I.B.</p>
			<p>
				d. The Appendix to these Clauses containing the Annexes referred to therein forms an integral part of
				these Clauses.
			</p>
			<h4>Clause 2</h4>
			<h5>Effect and invariability of the Clauses</h5>
			<p>
				a. These Clauses set out appropriate safeguards, including enforceable data subject rights and effective
				legal remedies, pursuant to Article 46(1) and Article 46 (2)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, with
				respect to data transfers from controllers to processors and/or processors to processors, standard
				contractual clauses pursuant to Article 28(7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, provided they are not
				modified, except to select the appropriate Module(s) or to add or update information in the Appendix.
				This does not prevent the Parties from including the standard contractual clauses laid down in these
				Clauses in a wider contract and/or to add other clauses or additional safeguards, provided that they do
				not contradict, directly or indirectly, these Clauses or prejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of
				data subjects.
			</p>
			<p>
				b. These Clauses are without prejudice to obligations to which the data exporter is subject by virtue of
				Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
			</p>
			<h4>Clause 3</h4>
			<h5>Third-party beneficiaries</h5>
			<p>
				a. Data subjects may invoke and enforce these Clauses, as third-party beneficiaries, against the data
				exporter and/or data importer, with the following exceptions:
			</p>
			<pre
				class="overflow-scroll whitespace-pre-wrap"
			><code>i. Clause 1, Clause 2, Clause 3, Clause 6, Clause 7; ii. Clause 8 --- Clause 8.1(b), 8.9(a), (c), (d) and (e); iii. Clause 9 --- Clause 9(a), (c), (d) and (e); iv. Clause 12 --- Clause 12(a), (d) and (f); v. Clause 13; vi. Clause 15.1(c), (d) and (e); vii. Clause 16(e); viii. Clause 18 --- Clause 18(a) and (b).</code></pre>
			<p>b. Paragraph (a) is without prejudice to rights of data subjects under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>
			<h4>Clause 4</h4>
			<h5>Interpretation</h5>
			<p>
				a. Where these Clauses use terms that are defined in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, those terms shall have
				the same meaning as in that Regulation.
			</p>
			<p>
				b. These Clauses shall be read and interpreted in the light of the provisions of Regulation (EU)
				2016/679.
			</p>
			<p>
				c. These Clauses shall not be interpreted in a way that conflicts with rights and obligations provided
				for in Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
			</p>
			<h4>Clause 5</h4>
			<h5>Hierarchy</h5>
			<p>
				In the event of a contradiction between these Clauses and the provisions of related agreements between
				the Parties, existing at the time these Clauses are agreed or entered into thereafter, these Clauses
				shall prevail.
			</p>
			<h4>Clause 6</h4>
			<h5>Description of the transfer(s)</h5>
			<p>
				The details of the transfer(s), and in particular the categories of personal data that are transferred
				and the purpose(s) for which they are transferred, are specified in Annex I.B.
			</p>
			<h4>Clause 7</h4>
			<h5>Intentionally Omitted</h5>
			<h3>SECTION II — OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES</h3>
			<h4>Clause 8</h4>
			<h5>Data protection safeguards</h5>
			<p>
				The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is
				able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its
				obligations under these Clauses.
			</p>
			<p>8.1<strong>Instructions</strong></p>
			<p>
				a. The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data
				exporter. The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.
			</p>
			<p>
				b. The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those
				instructions.
			</p>
			<p>8.2<strong>Purpose limitation</strong></p>
			<p>
				The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as
				set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.
			</p>
			<p>8.3<strong>Transparency</strong></p>
			<p>
				On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by
				the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business
				secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal
				data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a
				copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to
				understand the its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data
				subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted
				information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13
				and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
			</p>
			<p>8.4<strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
			<p>
				If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become
				outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall
				cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.
			</p>
			<p>8.5<strong>Duration of processing and erasure or return of data</strong></p>
			<p>
				Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the
				end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data
				exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data
				exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf
				and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to
				ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that
				prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to
				ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required
				under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data
				importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it
				has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the
				requirements under Clause 14(a).
			</p>
			<p>8.6<strong>Security of processing</strong></p>
			<p>
				a. The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate
				technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a
				breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised
				disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter "personal data breach"). In assessing the appropriate
				level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of
				implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the
				processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption
				or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in
				that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data
				to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data
				exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least
				implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry
				out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.
			</p>
			<p>
				b. The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the
				extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall
				ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality
				or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
			</p>
			<p>
				c. In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under
				these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including
				measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without
				undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a
				contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach
				(including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records
				concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including,
				where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not
				possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the
				information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be
				provided without undue delay.
			</p>
			<p>
				d. The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to
				comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent
				supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and
				the information available to the data importer.
			</p>
			<p>8.7<strong>Sensitive data</strong></p>
			<p>
				Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
				religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the
				purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person&amp;aposl;s sex
				life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter
				“sensitive data”), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards
				described in Annex I.B.
			</p>
			<p>8.8<strong>Onward transfers</strong></p>
			<p>
				The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from
				the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the
				European Union&nbsp;^2^&nbsp;(in the same country as the data importer or in another third country,
				hereinafter “onward transfer”) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the
				appropriate Module, or if:
			</p>
			<p>
				i. the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of
				Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;
			</p>
			<p>
				ii. the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of
				(EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;
			</p>
			<p>
				iii. the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the
				context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or
			</p>
			<p>
				iv. the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of
				another natural person.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under
				these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.
			</p>
			<p>8.9<strong>Documentation and compliance</strong></p>
			<p>
				a. The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that
				relate to the processing under these Clauses.
			</p>
			<p>
				b. The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data
				importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the
				data exporter.
			</p>
			<p>
				c. The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate
				compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter's request, allow for
				and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals
				or if there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may
				take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.
			</p>
			<p>
				d. The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits
				may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where
				appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.
			</p>
			<p>
				e. The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results
				of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
			</p>
			<h4>Clause 9</h4>
			<h5>Use of sub-processors</h5>
			<p>
				a. The data importer has the data exporter's general authorisation for the engagement of
				sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in
				writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at
				least 30 days in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such
				changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data
				exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.
			</p>
			<p>
				b. Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on
				behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in
				substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses,
				including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects.&nbsp;^3^&nbsp;The Parties agree
				that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The
				data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data
				importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.
			</p>
			<p>
				c. The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter's request, a copy of such a sub-processor
				agreement and any subsequent amendments to the data exporter. To the extent necessary to protect
				business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may
				redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.
			</p>
			<p>
				d. The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the
				sub-processor's obligations under its contract with the data importer. The data importer shall notify
				the data exporter of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract.
			</p>
			<p>
				e. The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby — in
				the event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent —
				the data exporter shall have the right to terminate the sub-processor contract and to instruct the
				sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.
			</p>
			<h4>Clause 10</h4>
			<h5>Data subject rights</h5>
			<p>
				a. The data importer shall promptly notify the data exporter of any request it has received from a data
				subject. It shall not respond to that request itself unless it has been authorised to do so by the data
				exporter.
			</p>
			<p>
				b. The data importer shall assist the data exporter in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data
				subjects' requests for the exercise of their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In this regard, the
				Parties shall set out in Annex II the appropriate technical and organisational measures, taking into
				account the nature of the processing, by which the assistance shall be provided, as well as the scope
				and the extent of the assistance required.
			</p>
			<p>
				c. In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the
				instructions from the data exporter.
			</p>
			<h4>Clause 11</h4>
			<h5>Redress</h5>
			<p>
				a. The data importer shall inform data subjects in a transparent and easily accessible format, through
				individual notice or on its website, of a contact point authorised to handle complaints. It shall deal
				promptly with any complaints it receives from a data subject.
			</p>
			<p>
				b. In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these
				Clauses, that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a timely fashion. The
				Parties shall keep each other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate, cooperate in
				resolving them.
			</p>
			<p>
				c. Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data
				importer shall accept the decision of the data subject to:
			</p>
			<pre
				class="overflow-scroll whitespace-pre-wrap"
			><code>i. lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the Member State of his/her habitual residence or place of work, or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13; ii. refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.</code></pre>
			<p>
				d. The Parties accept that the data subject may be represented by a not-for-profit body, organisation or
				association under the conditions set out in Article 80(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
			</p>
			<p>
				e. The data importer shall abide by a decision that is binding under the applicable EU or Member State
				law.
			</p>
			<p>
				f. The data importer agrees that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice his/her
				substantive and procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with applicable laws.
			</p>
			<h4>Clause 12</h4>
			<h5>Liability</h5>
			<p>
				a. Each Party shall be liable to the other Party/ies for any damages it causes the other Party/ies by
				any breach of these Clauses.
			</p>
			<p>
				b. The data importer shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to
				receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data importer or its sub-processor
				causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses.
			</p>
			<p>
				c. Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the data exporter shall be liable to the data subject, and the data
				subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data
				exporter or the data importer (or its sub-processor) causes the data subject by breaching the
				third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses. This is without prejudice to the liability of the
				data exporter and, where the data exporter is a processor acting on behalf of a controller, to the
				liability of the controller under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as applicable.
			</p>
			<p>
				d. The Parties agree that if the data exporter is held liable under paragraph (c) for damages caused by
				the data importer (or its sub-processor), it shall be entitled to claim back from the data importer that
				part of the compensation corresponding to the data importer's responsibility for the damage.
			</p>
			<p>
				e. Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to the data subject as a result of a
				breach of these Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally liable and the data
				subject is entitled to bring an action in court against any of these Parties.
			</p>
			<p>
				f. The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable under paragraph (e), it shall be entitled to claim
				back from the other Party/ies that part of the compensation corresponding to its / their responsibility
				for the damage.
			</p>
			<p>g. The data importer may not invoke the conduct of a sub-processor to avoid its own liability.</p>
			<h4>Clause 13</h4>
			<h5>Supervision</h5>
			<p>
				a. Where the data exporter is established in an EU Member State, the supervisory authority with
				responsibility for ensuring compliance by the data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards the
				data transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority. Where the data
				exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application
				of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) and has appointed a representative
				pursuant to Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the supervisory authority of the Member State in
				which the representative within the meaning of Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is established,
				as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority. Where the data exporter is not
				established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation
				(EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) without however having to appoint a representative
				pursuant to Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the supervisory authority of one of the Member
				States in which the data subjects whose personal data is transferred under these Clauses in relation to
				the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are located, as indicated in
				Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority.
			</p>
			<p>
				b. The data importer agrees to submit itself to the jurisdiction of and cooperate with the competent
				supervisory authority in any procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with these Clauses. In particular,
				the data importer agrees to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted
				by the supervisory authority, including remedial and compensatory measures. It shall provide the
				supervisory authority with written confirmation that the necessary actions have been taken.
			</p>
			<h3>SECTION III — LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES</h3>
			<h4>Clause 14</h4>
			<h5>Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses</h5>
			<p>
				a. The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third
				country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including
				any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent
				the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the
				understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms
				and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the
				objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these
				Clauses.
			</p>
			<p>
				b. The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in
				particular of the following elements:
			</p>
			<pre
				class="overflow-scroll whitespace-pre-wrap"
			><code>i. the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred; ii. the laws and practices of the third country of destination\" including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities \" relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards&nbsp;^4^; iii. any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.</code></pre>
			<p>
				c. The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its
				best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to
				cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.
			</p>
			<p>
				d. The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the
				competent supervisory authority on request.
			</p>
			<p>
				e. The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these
				Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject
				to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change
				in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application
				of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).
			</p>
			<p>
				f. Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to
				believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data
				exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to
				ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address
				the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate
				safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to
				do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it
				concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two
				Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant
				Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this
				Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.
			</p>
			<h4>Clause 15</h4>
			<h5>Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities</h5>
			<blockquote>
				<p>15.1<strong>Notification</strong></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				a. The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly
				(if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:
			</p>
			<pre
				class="overflow-scroll whitespace-pre-wrap"
			><code>i. receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or ii. becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.</code></pre>
			<p>
				b. If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the
				laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver
				of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible.
				The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request
				of the data exporter.
			</p>
			<p>
				c. Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide
				the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant
				information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data
				requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such
				challenges, etc.).
			</p>
			<p>
				d. The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the
				duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
			</p>
			<p>
				e. Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause
				14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these
				Clauses.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>15.2<strong>Review of legality and data minimisation</strong></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				a. The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether
				it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request
				if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the
				request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under
				international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same
				conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek
				interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial
				authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to
				do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations
				of the data importer under Clause 14(e).
			</p>
			<p>
				b. The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for
				disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the
				documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent
				supervisory authority on request.
			</p>
			<p>
				c. The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to
				a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.
			</p>
			<h3>SECTION IV — FINAL PROVISIONS</h3>
			<h4>Clause 16</h4>
			<h5>Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination</h5>
			<p>
				a. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these
				Clauses, for whatever reason.
			</p>
			<p>
				b. In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these
				Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until
				compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).
			</p>
			<p>
				c. The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing
				of personal data under these Clauses, where:
			</p>
			<pre
				class="overflow-scroll whitespace-pre-wrap"
			><code>i. the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension; ii. the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or iii. the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.</code></pre>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such non-compliance. Where
					the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to
					termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				d. Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to
				paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or
				deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data. The data importer shall certify
				the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer
				shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data
				importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer
				warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to
				the extent and for as long as required under that local law.
			</p>
			<p>
				e. Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission
				adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of
				personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal
				framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other
				obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
			</p>
			<h4>Clause 17</h4>
			<h5>Governing law</h5>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					These Clauses shall be governed by the law of the EU Member State in which the data exporter is
					established. Where such law does not allow for third-party beneficiary rights, they shall be
					governed by the law of another EU Member State that does allow for third-party beneficiary rights.
					The Parties agree that this shall be the law of Ireland.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h4>Clause 18</h4>
			<h5>Choice of forum and jurisdiction</h5>
			<p>a. Any dispute arising from these Clauses shall be resolved by the courts of an EU Member State.</p>
			<p>b. The Parties agree that those shall be the courts of Ireland.</p>
			<p>
				c. A data subject may also bring legal proceedings against the data exporter and/or data importer before
				the courts of the Member State in which he/she has his/her habitual residence.
			</p>
			<p>d. The Parties agree to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

					^1^&nbsp;Where the data exporter is a processor subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 acting on behalf
					of a Union institution or body as controller, reliance on these Clauses when engaging another
					processor (sub-processing) not subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 also ensures compliance with
					Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23
					October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by
					the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and
					repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295 of 21.11.2018, p. 39),
					to the extent these Clauses and the data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other
					legal act between the controller and the processor pursuant to Article 29(3) of Regulation (EU)
					2018/1725 are aligned. This will in particular be the case where the controller and processor rely
					on the standard contractual clauses included in Decision 2021/915.
				</p>
				<p>
					^2^&nbsp;The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of
					the European Union's internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The
					Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA
					Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data
					importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose
					of these Clauses.
				</p>
				<p>
					^3^&nbsp;This requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor acceding to these Clauses under the
					appropriate Module, in accordance with Clause 7.
				</p>
				<p>
					^4^&nbsp;As regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with these Clauses,
					different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment. Such elements may include
					relevant and documented practical experience with prior instances of requests for disclosure from
					public authorities, or the absence of such requests, covering a sufficiently representative
					time-frame. This refers in particular to internal records or other documentation, drawn up on a
					continuous basis in accordance with due diligence and certified at senior management level, provided
					that this information can be lawfully shared with third parties. Where this practical experience is
					relied upon to conclude that the data importer will not be prevented from complying with these
					Clauses, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective elements, and it is for the Parties
					to consider carefully whether these elements together carry sufficient weight, in terms of their
					reliability and representativeness, to support this conclusion. In particular, the Parties have to
					take into account whether their practical experience is corroborated and not contradicted by
					publicly available or otherwise accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence of
					requests within the same sector and/or the application of the law in practice, such as case law and
					reports by independent oversight bodies.
