				</p>
				<h2><strong>4. GDPR Terms</strong></h2>
				<p>
					The terms of this Section 4 (the "GDPR Terms") apply to the extent your Game Data includes
					information related to an identified or identifiable natural person that is subject to the European
					Union General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") or other applicable Data Protection Laws.
					Lower case terms used but not defined in these GDPR Terms such as "personal data," "personal data
					breach," "processing," "controller," "processor," "subprocessor" and "data subject" will have the
					same meaning as set forth in Article 4 of the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws. These
					GDPR Terms do not apply where PlayFab is a controller of the personal data of its customers.
				</p>
				<p>
					4.1.<strong
						>Compliance with the GDPR and other applicable Data Protection Laws for Processing of Personal
						Data.</strong
					>&nbsp;You and PlayFab agree to comply with all applicable provisions of the GDPR and other
					applicable Data Protection Laws. You agree you are the controller of personal data and PlayFab is
					the processor of such personal data, except when you act as a processor of personal data, in which
					case PlayFab is a subprocessor. PlayFab will process personal data only on your documented
					instructions. You agree that these Terms of Service, any other written Service Agreement with
					PlayFab, and your use and configuration of features in the PlayFab Services are your complete and
					final documented instructions to PlayFab for the processing of personal data. In any instance where
					the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws applies and you are a processor, you warrant to
					PlayFab that your instructions, including appointment of PlayFab as a processor or subprocessor,
					have been authorized by the relevant controller.
				</p>
				<p>4.2.<strong>Processing Details.</strong>&nbsp;You and PlayFab acknowledge and agree that:</p>
				<p>
					a) the nature and purpose of the processing is to provide the PlayFab Service pursuant to these
					documented instructions;<br />
					b) the subject matter of the processing is limited to personal data within the scope of the GDPR or
					other applicable Data Protection Laws;<br />
					c) the duration of the processing shall be for the duration of your right to use the PlayFab Service
					and until all personal data is deleted, or returned in accordance with your instructions;<br />
					d) the types of personal data processed by the PlayFab Service include those expressly identified in
					Article 4 of the GDPR or as set out in other applicable Data Protection Laws;<br />
					e) the categories of data subjects are employees, contractors, collaborators, and End Users;<br />
					f) PlayFab will process and transfer the personal data only on these documented instructions, unless
					required to do so by the European Union or member state law or other applicable regulatory authority
					to which PlayFab is subject; in such a case, PlayFab shall inform you of that legal requirement
					before processing (unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public
					interest); and<br />
					g) PlayFab will ensure that its personnel engaged in the processing of personal data (i) will comply
					with subsection (f) herein and (ii) have committed to maintain the confidentiality of any personal
					data even after their engagement ends.
				</p>
				<p>
					4.3.<strong>Data Subject Rights; Assistance with Requests.</strong>&nbsp;PlayFab will make the
					personal data of data subjects available to you and provide you the ability to fulfill data subject
					requests under the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws, both in a manner consistent with
					the functionality of the PlayFab Service and PlayFab's role as a processor. PlayFab shall comply
					with your reasonable requests to assist with your response to such a data subject request. If
					PlayFab receives a request from your data subject to exercise one or more of its rights under the
					GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws in connection with a game for which PlayFab is a data
					processor or subprocessor, PlayFab will redirect the data subject to make its request directly to
					you. You will be responsible for responding to any such request, including, where necessary, by
					using the functionality of the PlayFab Service.
				</p>
				<p>
					4.4.<strong>Records of Processing Activities and Reasonable Assistance.</strong>&nbsp;PlayFab shall
					maintain all records required by GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws and, to the extent
					applicable to the processing of personal data on your behalf, make them available to you upon
					request. PlayFab will provide you reasonable assistance in compliance with the obligations of the
					GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws, taking into account the nature of the processing and
					the information available to PlayFab.
				</p>
				<p>
					4.5.<strong>Data Security.</strong>&nbsp;You and PlayFab will implement appropriate technical and
					organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia,
					as appropriate:
				</p>
				<p>
					a) the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;<br />
					b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of
					processing systems and services;<br />
					c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the
					event of a physical or technical incident; and<br />
					d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and
					organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.
				</p>
				<p>
					PlayFab's security measures will be set forth in a PlayFab Security Policy. PlayFab will make that
					policy available to you, along with descriptions of the security controls in place for the PlayFab
					Services and other information you reasonably request regarding PlayFab security practices and
					policies. You are responsible for making an independent determination as to whether the technical
					and organizational measures for the PlayFab Services meets your requirements. You acknowledge and
					agree that (taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature,
					scope, context and purposes of the processing personal data as well as the risks to individuals) the
					security practices and policies implemented and maintained by PlayFab provide a level of security
					appropriate to the risk with respect to your personal data. You are responsible for implementing and
					maintaining privacy protections and security measures for components that you provide or control.
				</p>
				<p>
					4.6.<strong>Notice and Controls on use of Subprocessors.</strong>&nbsp;PlayFab may hire third
					parties to provide certain limited or ancillary services on its behalf. You consent to the
					engagement of these third parties and PlayFab Affiliates as subprocessors of personal data if such
					consent is required under law. PlayFab will inform you of new subprocessors it engages. You may
					object to new subprocessors by providing written notice to PlayFab that includes an explanation of
					the grounds for objection.
				</p>
				<p>
					PlayFab is responsible for its subprocessor's compliance with PlayFab's obligations in these GDPR
					Terms. When engaging any subprocessor, PlayFab will ensure via a written contract that the
					subprocessor may access and use personal data only to deliver the services PlayFab has retained them
					to provide and is prohibited from using personal data for any other purpose. PlayFab will ensure
					that subprocessors are bound by written agreements that require them to provide at least the level
					of data protection required of PlayFab by these terms. A current list of subprocessors can be found
					at<a href="https://playfab.com/privacy-terms/">https://playfab.com/privacy-terms/</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					4.7.<strong>Personal Data Breach.</strong>&nbsp;PlayFab shall notify you without undue delay after
					becoming aware of a personal data breach. Such notification will include that information a
					processor must provide to a controller under the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws to
					the extent such information is reasonably available to PlayFab.
				</p>
				<p>
					PlayFab shall make reasonable efforts to assist you in fulfilling your obligation to notify the
					relevant supervisory authority and data subjects of a personal data breach under A the GDPR or other
					applicable Data Protection Laws.
				</p>
				<p>
					4.8.<strong>Audit.</strong>&nbsp;PlayFab will conduct audits of its compliance with these GDPR terms
					as required by the GDPR or other applicable Data Protection Laws. Each audit will be performed by
					qualified, independent, third party and/or internal security auditors at PlayFab's selection and
					expense. Each audit will result in the generation of an audit report ("PlayFab Audit Report"), which
					PlayFab will make available to you upon request. The PlayFab Audit Report will be PlayFab's
					Proprietary Information and will clearly disclose any material findings by the auditor. PlayFab will
					promptly remediate issues raised in any PlayFab Audit Report to the satisfaction of the auditor.
				</p>
				<p>
					4.9.<strong>Transfer of personal data.</strong>&nbsp;You agree you have a legal transfer mechanism
					for the transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organization in accordance
					with Data Protection Laws. All transfers of personal data to a third country or an international
					organization will be subject to appropriate safeguards as described in the GDPR or other applicable
					Data Protection Laws and such transfers and safeguards will be documented according to such laws.
				</p>
				<p>
					If You or PlayFab transfers personal data from the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the
					United Kingdom to a third country or an international organization not recognized by the European
					Commission, the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, or UK Information
					Commissioner's Office, respectively as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data,
					the parties will be deemed to have executed Module 2 of the Standard Contractual Clauses at<a
						href="https://playfab.com/privacy-terms/"
						>https://playfab.com/privacy-terms/</a
					>&nbsp;(the “2021 Standard Contractual Clauses”), revised as necessary per the below.

					and the United Kingdom:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Switzerland</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>The parties adopt the GDPR standard for all data transfers.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>

								<p>Clause 17: The parties agree that the governing jurisdiction is Ireland.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Clause 18: The parties agree that the forum is Ireland. The parties agree to
									interpret the Standard Contractual Clauses so that Data Subjects in Switzerland are
									able to sue for their rights in Switzerland in accordance with Clause 18(c).
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									The parties agree to interpret the Standard Contractual Clauses so that “Data

						<ul>

					5.1. Subject to the Terms, you may sign up for the PlayFab Development Mode services, which PlayFab
					will provide to you without charge up to certain limits. PlayFab may offer you the ability to use
					additional resources and services without charge for a trial period. Usage of resources and services
					beyond the trial period, usage of the PlayFab Development Mode Services over the designated limits,
					or the use of other resources or services offered on the Website will require your purchase of
					additional resources or services via individually priced services or an appropriate paid
					Subscription plan. The PlayFab Development Mode Services limits, and the pricing for additional
					resources and services, can be found on the Website at<a href="https://playfab.com/pricing/"

					>&nbsp;(or such other URL as PlayFab may provide).
				</p>
				<p>
					5.2. Payments for all purchased resources and services are due and must be made according to the
					pricing and related terms in the services description published in the Website. Unless otherwise
					noted in the service description, all fees will be billed in advance on a monthly basis (or at the

					invoice. You must provide PlayFab with a credit card, and PlayFab will automatically charge your
					credit card based on the paid Subscription plan and any individually priced services you have
					selected on the due date unless you have raised a good faith objection prior to the due date. At
					PlayFab's sole discretion, PlayFab may also agree with you to accept your payments via wire
					transfer, automated clearinghouse or PayPal. At PlayFab's sole discretion, PlayFab may also agree to
					accept your payments via alternative means. Late payments will bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per
					month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). To the fullest extent permitted by law, you
					waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not
					affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on PlayFab's measurements of your
					use of the PlayFab Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted
					by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of PlayFab and only in the form of credit for the
					PlayFab Services. Nothing in these Terms obligates PlayFab to extend credit to any party. You
					acknowledge and agree that any credit card and other billing and payment information that you
					provide to PlayFab may be shared by PlayFab with companies who work on PlayFab's behalf, such as
					payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting

					thirty (30) days after notifying you of the fee increase. Changes to the fees or payment policies

					reason.

					Development Mode include trail and evaluation of the PlayFab service, and the development and
					limited launch of games and applications using the PlayFab service. High volume usage of the PlayFab
					service, such as for load testing, is not allowed in Development Mode. If your Games misuse the
					PlayFab Development Mode Services, requiring intervention from PlayFab, PlayFab will work with you
					to quarantine the Game(s) to a high-risk server instance, address the misuse and/or to migrate your
					Games to an appropriate paid Tier plan for enhanced support. Notwithstanding the above, PlayFab
					reserves the right to terminate your use of the PlayFab Development Mode Service at any time for any
					reason..

					gross receipts taxes imposed in lieu of taxes on income or profits, or taxes on our property
					ownership. If any taxes are required to be withheld on payments you make to us, you may deduct such
					taxes from the amount owed to us and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority; provided,
					however, that you promptly secure and deliver an official receipt for those withholdings and other
					documents we reasonably request to claim a foreign tax credit or refund. You must ensure that any
					taxes withheld are minimized to the extent possible under applicable law.

					terms for those Add-ons, if any. You acknowledge for each Add-on you subscribe to or purchase
					through the PlayFab Services, these Terms constitute a binding agreement between you and the third

				<h2>
					<strong>11. Modification, suspension, and Termination of the PlayFab Services</strong>
				</h2>
				<p>
					11.1. PlayFab is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its
					users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the PlayFab Services may change from
					time to time without prior notice to you, subject to the terms in Section 5.3. PlayFab intends to
					minimize changes to functionality or APIs that will negatively impact your Games. When making such
					changes, PlayFab will create a new version of the API and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
					continue to support the old version of the API for at least ninety (90) days. However, in the event
					of security issues, issues affecting system health or other exigent circumstances such as changes in
					the laws or regulations applicable to PlayFab or the PlayFab Services, PlayFab may terminate support
					for the old version of the API without advance notice. Changes to the form and nature of the PlayFab
					Services will be effective with respect to all versions of the PlayFab Services. Examples of changes
					to the form and nature of the PlayFab Services include, without limitation, changes to fee and
					payment policies, security patches, added functionality, and other enhancements.

					11.2. PlayFab may suspend or terminate your use of the PlayFab Services if: (a) it is reasonably

					terminate until the end of the stated term in such agreement or payment terms. In such case, your
					obligations under these Terms will continue until the end of the stated term in the agreement or
					payment terms. You will not receive any refunds if you cancel your account.
				</p>
				<p>
					11.4. You are solely responsible for exporting your Game Data and Games from the PlayFab Services

				</p>
				<p>
					11.5. PlayFab will provide you twelve (12) months advance notice if PlayFab ceases to do business
					and discontinues providing any PlayFab Services, unless (a) such termination of the PlayFab Service

					(b) PlayFab or its Affiliates makes available a service that is substantially similar to the
					discontinued PlayFab Services.

					but Sections 2.3, 3.3, 7.1, 8.2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.3 and 17 shall continue to be effective after
					these Terms are terminated.
				</p>

					trade secret.

					PlayFab Services. If these options are not commercially reasonable, we may terminate your rights to

				</p>
				<p>
					14.5. Obligations. Each party must notify the other promptly of a claim under this Section. The

				</p>
				<h2><strong>16. Changes to the Terms</strong></h2>
				<p>
					16.1. PlayFab may make changes to the Terms from time to time. If we change the Terms in any

					Data in the PlayFab Services, PlayFab or its Affiliates will attempt to redirect the law enforcement
					agency to request that data directly from you. If compelled to disclose Game Data to law

				</p>
				<p>
					17.3. There are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are independent

					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					17.6. You agree that if PlayFab does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is
					contained in the Terms (or which PlayFab has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not
					be taken to be a formal waiver of PlayFab's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be
					available to PlayFab. If any provision of the Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any
					reason, the remaining provisions will continue in full force without being impaired or invalidated
					in any way.
				</p>

				</p>
				<p>

					of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and PlayFab agree
					to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within King County, Washington, to
